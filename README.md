# String Manipulation: Sort of String

You are given N strings.
For each string, perform the following sorting operations:

1. Rearrange the alphabets in the string in terms of frequency. i.e. the alphabet having greater frequency comes first.

2. If two or more alphabets have the same frequency, the alphabet which is lexicographically small comes first.

## Build

In the solution path run `dotnet build` to build the projects.

## Running Project

Move to the Console Project `cd SortString` and execute `dotnet run` to run the project.

The console project will request the number of strings, once we entered the number it will request the N strings. When all the strings were entered it will displayed the list of string sorted by the algorithm.

## Running unit tests

Move to the Unit Test project `cd ..\SortString.Test\` and execute `dotnet test` to run the unit tests.
